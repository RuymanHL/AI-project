# Project Title: It is still under consideration (please read the explanation in the summary)

Building AI course project

## Summary

In order to present a final project for the building AI course, I thought it appropriate to comment that I am currently working on a doctoral thesis that covers, in a more in-depth way, many of the concepts presented in this course. The idea of my thesis project is to develop technologies to contribute in some way to establishing a balance between the performance of certain activities and the conservation of biodiversity. However, the title of the project is still under consideration and it is not possible for me to provide certain information on this project due to confidentiality issues. Therefore, if this fact could be a hindrance to be able to earn final project honors on my certificate, I kindly ask you to contact me through my e-mail: ruyman.hernandez101@alu.ulpgc.es asking me the information which is strictly necessary, so as to I can inform the director of my thesis, and considering if it is possible to provide such information.

## Background

Currently, I am carrying out training activities in order to develop my doctoral thesis at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria University (Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, ULPGC), which is framed in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although the thesis is still in its early stages, the research involves the implementation of a system based on deep learning techniques and the application area is related to the preservation of biodiversity.

## How is it used?

This information cannot yet be provided as it may be subject to confidentiality issues.

## Data sources and AI methods

Some of the data currently available has been obtained from various websites via the internet, however, other data is expected to be provided by regional authorities. The experiments that have been carried out up to the time of writing have been developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques.

## Challenges

Mentioning the challenges and the limitations of the project involves providing sensitive information about the project, such as its objectives. This information cannot yet be provided as it may be subject to confidentiality issues.

## What next?

It is expected that the results of this project will provide new scientific knowledge related to deep learning techniques applied to the biodiversity area. The results will be disseminated to the scientific community through papers and the PhD thesis itself, and popularized to the general public according to the communication channels and regulations of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

## Acknowledgments

The persons or entities that provide some type of collaboration will be duly credited in the respective publications related to this project.
